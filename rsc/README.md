## R Short Course

This repo contains files for a series of workshops titled, "R Short Course".
These workshops follow a hybrid format: a week before the scheduled meeting
time participants will be given access to pre-recorded content and recommended
readings to review at their own pace.  The following week, we’ll meet at the posted
time for 90 minutes over Zoom to answer questions and work on a collection of exercises.
At the end of the course, we’ll gather for a 3-hour practicum, in which we’ll
program a console version of the game “Mastermind”.

Pre-recorded video discussions are distributed via YouTube.  These videos are
only available to the University of Michigan community, meaning you need to be
logged into your @umich.edu email address in the browswer you are viewing them in.

## Week 1 - Getting Started

In week 1, we’ll discuss the following topics:  
  + creation and naming of objects,
  + R’s global environment,
  + arithmetic operations,
  + R’s package system, and
  + reading and writing data.

### Recommended reading

In addition to the notes linked below under *Workshop Content*, I'd recommend
reading the following chapters from Hadley Wickham's
[R for Data Science]((https://r4ds.had.co.nz/):
  + [Introduction](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)
  + [Workflow: basics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html)
  + [Workflow: scripts](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-scripts.html)

If you are new to programming, you may also find these chapters from
Garrett Grolemund's [Hands on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)
helpful:  
  + Part 1, Chapters 1-3
  + Appendices, A-D. 

Finally, new and experienced programmers alike benefit from following style guidelines
to write readable, literate, code. I recommend the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
For part 1, I'd suggest reading:
  + "Welcome"
  + Section 1, "Files"
  + Section 2, excluding 2.3 (function calls) and 2.4 (control flow) which fit better with future parts.

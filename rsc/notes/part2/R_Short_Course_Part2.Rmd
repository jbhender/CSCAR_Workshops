## ![](../../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} Vectors {#vectors}

A recorded discussion of this material can be found 
[here](https://youtu.be/LHvPh_6Gds4). 

The material in this section is largely based on the recommended readings:  

   - *R for Data Science*, [Chapter 20](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html)
   - *Advanced R*, [Vectors](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html)
     and [Subsetting](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/subsetting.html).

Vectors are the basic building blocks of many R data structures including
rectangular data structures or *data.frames* most commonly used for analysis. 

There are two kinds of vectors: *atomic vectors* and *lists* (aka
*recursive vectors*). Every vector has
two defining properties aside from the values it holds:

  - A *type* (or *mode*) referring to what type of data it holds, and 
  - A *length* referring to the number of elements comprising it.

Use `typeof()` to determine a vector's type and 
`length()` to determine its length.

In **R**, *scalars* are just vectors with length one. 
   
### Atomic Vectors

The elements in atomic vectors must all be of the same *type*.  
Here are the most important types: 

  - Logical: `TRUE`, `FALSE`
  - Integer: `1L`
  - Double: `2.4`
  - Character: `"some words"`

Two less commonly used types are *raw* and *complex*. The *mode* of a vector of
integers or doubles is *numeric*, the *mode* of other types is the same as the
type.

To create new vectors without assigning values to them use `c()` or 
`vector(mode, length)`. 

```{r, 35_vector}
cvec = c()
cvec
length(cvec)
typeof(cvec)

vvec = vector('character', length = 4)
length(vvec)
typeof(vvec)
vvec
```

When the required length can be determined in advance, the latter 
construction is preferred -- especially for long vectors.
This is because it pre-allocates the entire vector which avoids
inefficient repeat copying owing to R's *copy on modify* semantics. 


### Attributes

Attributes are metadata associated with a vector.  

Some of the most important and commonly used attributes are:

  - names
  - class
  - dim

Each of these can be accessed and set using functions of the same name. 

#### Names

There are a few ways to create a vector with names.

```{r, 36_names}
## Ex1: assign with names()
x = 1:3
names(x) = c('Uno', 'Dos', 'Tres')
x

##Ex2: quoted names
x = c( 'Uno' = 1, 'Dos' = 2, 'Tres' = 3 )
x

##Ex3: bare names
x = c( Uno = 1, Dos = 2, Tres = 3)
x

##Ex4: 
names(x)
```

#### class

The *class* of an object plays an important role in R's *S3* object oriented
system and determines how an object is treated by various functions.

The class of a vector is generally the same as its *mode* or *type*.

```{r, 37_class}
class(FALSE); class(0L); class(1); class('Two'); class( list() )
```

Note the difference after we change the *class* of *x*.  
```{r, 38_class}
x
class(x) = 'character'
print(x)
```

It is generally better to use explicit conversion functions such as 
`as.character()` to change an object's class as simply modifying the class
attribute, as in the previous example, will not guarantee the object is a 
valid member of that class. 

#### dim

We use `dim()` to access or set the *dimensions* of an object.  
Two special classes where dimensions matter are *array* (including *matrix*),
and *data.frame*. 

Matrices are 2-dimension arrays. There was a distinct matrix class prior to 
recent version of **R**, but the matrix class now inherits from the array class 
-- meaning every matrix is also an array. 

Both matrices and arrays are really just long vectors with a *dim* attribute. 

```{r, 39_dim}
# Matrix class
x = matrix(1:10, nrow = 5, ncol = 2)
dim(x)
class(x)
dim(x) = c(2, 5)
x
```
The above demonstrates that **R** matrices are stored in *column-major order*.  
The matrix class is the two-dimensional special cases of the array class.

```{r, 40_dim}
dim(x) = c(5, 1, 2)
class(x)
x

dim(x) = c(5, 2, 1)
x
class(x)
```

#### Arbitrary attributes

See a list of all attributes associated with a vector using `attributes()`. 
Access and assign specific attributes using `attr()`.

```{r, 51_attr}
# Assign an a new attribute color
attr(x, 'color') = 'green'
attributes(x)
class( attributes(x) )

# Access or assign specific attributes
attr(x, 'dim')
attr(x, 'dim') = c(5, 2)
class(x)
x

# Assign NULL to remove attributes
attr(x, 'color') = NULL
attributes(x)
```

## ![](../../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} Vector Indexing {#index}

A recorded discussion of this material can be found 
[here](https://youtu.be/sWsVAVjJzLE). 

Access elements of an atomic vector `x` using square brackets `x[]`.
There are three types of indexing used within square brackets for 
atomic vectors: indexing by position, indexing by name, and logical indexing. 

Below are examples of positional indexing, in which we request elements from 
on or more specific positions. 

```{r pos_index}
# create a vector
x = 2 * (1:10)

# extract a single element
x[7]
x[1]

# extract multiple elements
x[c(1, 10)]

# extract a range of elements
x[5:10]
x[seq(5, 10, 1)]
```

When the names attribute of a vector is not `NULL`, the vector can be indexed
by name.

```{r name_index}
code = 1:27
names(code) = c(LETTERS, ' ') # built in vector of A-Z
code[c('O', 'P', 'E', 'N', ' ', 'S', 'O', 'U', 'R', 'C', 'E')]
```

Except when looping over an entire vector, it is generally safer to index by 
name than position in the sense that you're less likely to introduce a hard to
identify bug when using names. 

Finally, a vector can also be subset using a logical vector of the same length
as the vector itself.  In this case, the positions in the logical vector 
containing `TRUE` are returned.  This is most useful when the logical vector
is constructed using Boolean operations on the vector itself, as in the third
line of the example below. 

```{r logical_index}
y = c('pi' = pi, 'e' = exp(1), 'phi' = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 )
y[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
y[y > 2]
```

You can read more about various ways to subset a vector in section [20.4.5](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html#vector-subsetting) of
*R for Data Science*. 

### Lists

*Lists* provide a more flexible data structure which can hold elements
of multiple types, including other vectors. This can be useful for bringing
together multiple object types into a single place. 

Lists are the most flexible object structure commonly used by beginner or
intermediate R users. Lists are also the basis for many of R's S3 classes
including the `data.frame` class and model objects like those returend by 
`lm()`. 

To construct a list with specific objects, use the constructor `list()`. 
An empty list of a specific length can also be constructed using `vector()`, 
e.g.`vector(mode = 'list', length = 10)`.  It's almost always best to name
the elements of a list, though it's not strictly required. 

Here we construct a list containing two length one character vectors `hello` 
and `catchphrase` and one length three character vector `goodbyes`. 

```{r list_create}
messages = list(
  hello = 'Hello World!',
  catchphrase = 'Cowabunga, dude.',
  goodbyes = c('Hasta la vista, baby.', 'So long.', 'Later gator.')
)
```

We can create a new list from the elements of an existing list using single
square brackets `[]`. This can be done by position or name, with the latter
generally preferred. 

```{r list_pos}
# selecting a sub-list by position
messages[1:2]
messages[1]
messages[c(1, 3)]

# selecting a sub-list by name 
messages['goodbyes']
messages[c('catchphrase', 'goodbyes')]
```

We can also select a specific element from a list using double square brackets
`[[]]` (preferred) or the `$` operator as in the examples below.

```{r list_element}
# selecting a single element by position
messages[[2]]

# selecting a single element by name
messages$hello
messages[['hello']]
```

Note that the objects returned are the elements themselves 
(in this case the `hello` character vector) and not a list with one element.  
This distinction between `[]` and `[[]]` when used to subset a list often
trips up those new to R. 

When we want to work with the elements of a list or list-like object, an
alternative to indexing is the `with()` function.  The `with()` function
creates an environment in which we can execute expressions (R code) while
referring to elements of a list using their bare (unquoted) names. This
environment is nested with the global environment, so, while the list takes
precedence, we can mix list elements with global objects.

In the example below, we use `with()` to avoid repeated indexing of the
`messages` list created above while constructing a message to write to the 
console with the function `cat()`. 

```{r with}
# globals
hello = 'Hi!'
hi = 'hi'

# what we might do w/o with()
cat(
  messages[['hello']], 
  '\n\n',
  messages[['catchphrase']], 
  '\n\n',
  messages[['goodbyes']][3], 
  '\n',
  sep = ''
)

# using with
with(messages,
     cat(hello, '\n\n', catchphrase, '\n\n', goodbyes[3], '\n', sep = '')
)
```

You can read more about list indexing in section 20.5 of *R for Data Science* [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html#important-types-of-atomic-vector).

## ![](../../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} The *data.frame* class {#data.frame}

A recorded discussion of this material can be found 
[here](https://youtu.be/ttwFPRCZgE0). 

The *data.frame* class in **R** is a *list* whose elements (columns) all have
the same length.  A *data.frame* has attributes *names* with elements of the 
list constituting its columns, *row.names* with values uniquely identifying 
each row, and also has *class* *data.frame*. 

Construct a new *data.frame* using `data.frame()`.  Here is an example. 

```{r, 52_df}
df = 
  data.frame( 
    ID = 1:10,
    Group = sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE),
    Var1 = rnorm(10),
    Var2 = seq(0, 1, length.out = 10),
    Var3 = rep(c('a', 'b'), each = 5)
  )

names(df)
dim(df)
length(df)
nrow(df)
class(df$Var3)
```

We can access the values of a data frame both like a list:
```{r, 53_dfsubset}
df$ID
df[['Var3']]
```

or like an array:

```{r, 54_df}
df[1:5, ]
df[, 'Var2']
```

This works because the subset operator `[` has behavior that depends on the
class of the object being subset. 

In terms of style, when selecting a single element the double bracket notation
`df[['Var3']]` (returning an atomic vector) is preferred over an array-like
subset notation `df[, 'Var3']` (also returning an atomic vector). Note that when
selecting two or more columns, e.g. `df[, c('ID', 'Var3')]`, the object
returned is a data.frame. To select a single column data.frame, use the 
argument `drop = FALSE`, e.g. `df[, 'Var3', drop = FALSE]`.

Those interested can read more about data frames in *Advanced R* 
[here](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html#data-frames).

### ![](../../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} Methods for the data.frame class {#recs}

In the 
[RECS Case Study](https://github.com/jbhender/CSCAR_Workshops/tree/main/rsc/examples/examples/part2/recs_case_study.R)
([video](https://youtu.be/G2xf82iHdIM)) I provide an overview of some important
methods for working with data.frames, including:  
  + `subset()` - for selecting rows satisfying given conditions,
  + `aggregate()` - for computing summary statistics, often by group,
  + `merge()` - for joining two data.frames based on common rows,
  + `reshape()` - for pivoting a data frame between longer and wider formats,
  + `with()` - for constructing an environment in which to evaluate expressions
  using bare column names,
  + `within()` - like `with()`, but returning a copy of the entire environment
  which is useful for adding multiple columns to an existing data.frame.
  
Popular alternatives to the functions above are the 
[tidyverse](tidyerse.org) -- especially *dplyr* and *tidyr* -- and 
[data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) packages.
